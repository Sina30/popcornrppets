# popcornrp-pets
A collection of free-to-use add-on pets and other other animals! Goes great with keep-companion!

I recommend you use these add-on peds with: [keep-companion-ox](https://github.com/alberttheprince/keep-companion-ox)

Please donate to the creator of keep-companion, whose resource has been a fun tool for our RP server! [here](https://ko-fi.com/swkeep)

Add this to your server files and server config and ensure it, or move the subfolders to your streamed peds folder. 

Still trying to figure out how to stream add-on peds? You can use this folder and fxmanifest.lua file to do so! Just follow the example with the chow chow/other peds added here.

## 9. Giant Cockroach



Giant tarantulas, zombies, and now giant cockroaches?! I’d say the world is ending, but it’s probably just another chemical leak from Humanes Lab into the water supply…
